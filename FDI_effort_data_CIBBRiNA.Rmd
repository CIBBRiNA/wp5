## CIBBRiNA Case Study 1: Northern Gillnets {.tabset}

Gears: GNC,GND,GNS,GTR,GTN

Areas: 27.5.a, 27.4.a, 27.4.b, 27.4.c, 27.3.a.20, 27.3.a.21, 27.3.b.23, 27.3.c.22, 27.3.d.24, 27.3.d.25, 27.3.d.26

Countries: Sweden, Denmark, Poland, Germany (Iceland and Norway does not report to the EU FDI data call)


### Days at sea by year

The first plot is showing the effort as Days at sea by year, when filtering the effort at EU level for the CIBBRiNA case study fleets. The EU level can only be filtered by gears and areas, and not by country.

The second plot is showing the effort as Days at sea by year, when filtering the effort at Country level for the CIBBRiNA case study fleets. The Country level is filtered by the CS countries, gears and areas. When submitting data to the FDI the country can mark data as confidential, typically if there are less than 3 vessels in the aggregation level of data submission. Therefore a part of the effort is missing in this plot.

The third plot is showing the effort as Days at sea by year, when filtering the effort at Country level for the CIBBRiNA case study fleets. The Country level is filtered by the CS countries, gears and areas. When submitting data to the FDI the country can mark data as confidential, typically if there are less than 3 vessels in the aggregation level of data submission. In this plot, the difference between the effort on EU level and the country level is added as 'Unknown'. This difference can be due to data marked as confidential, but can also be due to other MS than the ones defined in the case study have fishing effort in this fleet.

The first plot is showing the effort as Fishing days sea by year, when filtering the effort at EU level for the CIBBRiNA case study fleets. The EU level can only be filtered by gears and areas, and not by country.

The second plot is showing the effort as Fishing days by year, when filtering the effort at Country level for the CIBBRiNA case study fleets. The Country level is filtered by the CS countries, gears and areas. When submitting data to the FDI the country can mark data as confidential, typically if there are less than 3 vessels in the aggregation level of data submission. Therefore a part of the effort is missing in this plot.

The third plot is showing the effort as Fishing days by year, when filtering the effort at Country level for the CIBBRiNA case study fleets. The Country level is filtered by the CS countries, gears and areas. When submitting data to the FDI the country can mark data as confidential, typically if there are less than 3 vessels in the aggregation level of data submission. In this plot, the difference between the effort on EU level and the country level is added as 'Unknown'. This difference can be due to data marked as confidential, but can also be due to other MS than the ones defined in the case study have fishing effort in this fleet.

### Vessel length

The first plot is showing the fishing days by vessel length categories within CS fleet at EU level. 

The second plot is showing the fishing days by vessel length categories within CS fleet at country level, where the y-axis is not fixed. 

The third plot is showing the fishing days by vessel length categories within CS fleet at country level, where the y-axis is fixed, so it is easier to get an overview of the relative fishing effort by MS. 

The fourth plot is showing the fishing days by vessel length categories within CS fleet at country level, where the y-axis is shown as percentage.

Note that after 2021, there was a requirement to report the vessel length in group 0-8 m in the Baltic, and 0-10 m in other areas. In the other years the vessel length category to report was 0-10 m.

### Metier level 6

The metier level 6 is defined in the DCF EU-MAP and is managed by the RCG ISSG Metier and transversal variables, and used for reporting in FDI and ICES data calls. The code has the components 'Gear'_'Target species assemblage'_'Mesh size range'_'Selection devices'. See more documentation at: https://github.com/ices-eg/RCGs/tree/master/Metiers.

Note: There can be a difference between the gears reported in the GEAR_TYPE variable and in the Metier code on level 4.

As there are many minor metier codes, only the top 10 metier codes by fishing days are shown in the plot below, the rest are grouped into 'Other'.

The first plot is showing the fishing days by metier level 6 within CS fleet at EU level. 

The second plot is showing the fishing days by metier level 6 within CS fleet at country level, where the y-axis is not fixed. 

The third plot is showing the fishing days by metier level 6 within CS fleet at country level, where the y-axis is fixed, so it is easier to get an overview of the relative fishing effort by MS. 

The fourth plot is showing the fishing days by metier level 6 within CS fleet at country level, where the y-axis is shown as percentage.

### Days at sea by year

The first plot is showing the effort as Days at sea by year, when filtering the effort at EU level for the CIBBRiNA case study fleets. The EU level can only be filtered by gears and areas, and not by country.

The second plot is showing the effort as Days at sea by year, when filtering the effort at Country level for the CIBBRiNA case study fleets. The Country level is filtered by the CS countries, gears and areas. When submitting data to the FDI the country can mark data as confidential, typically if there are less than 3 vessels in the aggregation level of data submission. Therefore a part of the effort is missing in this plot.

The third plot is showing the effort as Days at sea by year, when filtering the effort at Country level for the CIBBRiNA case study fleets. The Country level is filtered by the CS countries, gears and areas. When submitting data to the FDI the country can mark data as confidential, typically if there are less than 3 vessels in the aggregation level of data submission. In this plot, the difference between the effort on EU level and the country level is added as 'Unknown'. This difference can be due to data marked as confidential, but can also be due to other MS than the ones defined in the case study have fishing effort in this fleet.

The second plot is showing the effort as kW Fishing days by year, when filtering the effort at Country level for the CIBBRiNA case study fleets. The Country level is filtered by the CS countries, gears and areas. When submitting data to the FDI the country can mark data as confidential, typically if there are less than 3 vessels in the aggregation level of data submission. Therefore a part of the effort is missing in this plot.

The third plot is showing the effort as kW Fishing days by year, when filtering the effort at Country level for the CIBBRiNA case study fleets. The Country level is filtered by the CS countries, gears and areas. When submitting data to the FDI the country can mark data as confidential, typically if there are less than 3 vessels in the aggregation level of data submission. In this plot, the difference between the effort on EU level and the country level is added as 'Unknown'. This difference can be due to data marked as confidential, but can also be due to other MS than the ones defined in the case study have fishing effort in this fleet.

### Vessel length

The first plot is showing the fishing days by vessel length categories within CS fleet at EU level. 

The second plot is showing the fishing days by vessel length categories within CS fleet at country level, where the y-axis is not fixed. 

The third plot is showing the fishing days by vessel length categories within CS fleet at country level, where the y-axis is fixed, so it is easier to get an overview of the relative fishing effort by MS. 

The fourth plot is showing the fishing days by vessel length categories within CS fleet at country level, where the y-axis is shown as percentage.

### Metier level 6

The metier level 6 is defined in the DCF EU-MAP and is managed by the RCG ISSG Metier and transversal variables, and used for reporting in FDI and ICES data calls. The code has the components 'Gear'_'Target species assemblage'_'Mesh size range'_'Selection devices'. See more documentation at: https://github.com/ices-eg/RCGs/tree/master/Metiers.

Note: There can be a difference between the gears reported in the GEAR_TYPE variable and in the Metier code on level 4.

As there are many minor metier codes, only the top 10 metier codes by fishing days are shown in the plot below, the rest are grouped into 'Other'.

The first plot is showing the fishing days by metier level 6 within CS fleet at EU level. 

The second plot is showing the fishing days by metier level 6 within CS fleet at country level, where the y-axis is not fixed. 

The third plot is showing the fishing days by metier level 6 within CS fleet at country level, where the y-axis is fixed, so it is easier to get an overview of the relative fishing effort by MS. 

The fourth plot is showing the fishing days by metier level 6 within CS fleet at country level, where the y-axis is shown as percentage.

### kW Days at sea by year

The first plot is showing the effort as kW Days at sea by year, when filtering the effort at EU level for the CIBBRiNA case study fleets. The EU level can only be filtered by gears and areas, and not by country.

The second plot is showing the effort as kW Days at sea by year, when filtering the effort at Country level for the CIBBRiNA case study fleets. The Country level is filtered by the CS countries, gears and areas. When submitting data to the FDI the country can mark data as confidential, typically if there are less than 3 vessels in the aggregation level of data submission. Therefore a part of the effort is missing in this plot.

The third plot is showing the effort as kW Days at sea by year, when filtering the effort at Country level for the CIBBRiNA case study fleets. The Country level is filtered by the CS countries, gears and areas. When submitting data to the FDI the country can mark data as confidential, typically if there are less than 3 vessels in the aggregation level of data submission. In this plot, the difference between the effort on EU level and the country level is added as 'Unknown'. This difference can be due to data marked as confidential, but can also be due to other MS than the ones defined in the case study have fishing effort in this fleet.

### Vessel length

The first plot is showing the fishing days by vessel length categories within CS fleet at EU level. 

The second plot is showing the fishing days by vessel length categories within CS fleet at country level, where the y-axis is not fixed. 

The third plot is showing the fishing days by vessel length categories within CS fleet at country level, where the y-axis is fixed, so it is easier to get an overview of the relative fishing effort by MS. 

The fourth plot is showing the fishing days by vessel length categories within CS fleet at country level, where the y-axis is shown as percentage.

### Metier level 6

The metier level 6 is defined in the DCF EU-MAP and is managed by the RCG ISSG Metier and transversal variables, and used for reporting in FDI and ICES data calls. The code has the components 'Gear'_'Target species assemblage'_'Mesh size range'_'Selection devices'. See more documentation at: https://github.com/ices-eg/RCGs/tree/master/Metiers.

Note: There can be a difference between the gears reported in the GEAR_TYPE variable and in the Metier code on level 4.

As there are many minor metier codes, only the top 10 metier codes by fishing days are shown in the plot below, the rest are grouped into 'Other'.

The first plot is showing the fishing days by metier level 6 within CS fleet at EU level. 

The second plot is showing the fishing days by metier level 6 within CS fleet at country level, where the y-axis is not fixed. 

The third plot is showing the fishing days by metier level 6 within CS fleet at country level, where the y-axis is fixed, so it is easier to get an overview of the relative fishing effort by MS. 

The fourth plot is showing the fishing days by metier level 6 within CS fleet at country level, where the y-axis is shown as percentage.

### Days at sea by year

The first plot is showing the effort as Days at sea by year, when filtering the effort at EU level for the CIBBRiNA case study fleets. The EU level can only be filtered by gears and areas, and not by country.

The second plot is showing the effort as Days at sea by year, when filtering the effort at Country level for the CIBBRiNA case study fleets. The Country level is filtered by the CS countries, gears and areas. When submitting data to the FDI the country can mark data as confidential, typically if there are less than 3 vessels in the aggregation level of data submission. Therefore a part of the effort is missing in this plot.

The third plot is showing the effort as Days at sea by year, when filtering the effort at Country level for the CIBBRiNA case study fleets. The Country level is filtered by the CS countries, gears and areas. When submitting data to the FDI the country can mark data as confidential, typically if there are less than 3 vessels in the aggregation level of data submission. In this plot, the difference between the effort on EU level and the country level is added as 'Unknown'. This difference can be due to data marked as confidential, but can also be due to other MS than the ones defined in the case study have fishing effort in this fleet.

### Vessel length

The first plot is showing the fishing days by vessel length categories within CS fleet at EU level. 

The second plot is showing the fishing days by vessel length categories within CS fleet at country level, where the y-axis is not fixed. 

The third plot is showing the fishing days by vessel length categories within CS fleet at country level, where the y-axis is fixed, so it is easier to get an overview of the relative fishing effort by MS. 

The fourth plot is showing the fishing days by vessel length categories within CS fleet at country level, where the y-axis is shown as percentage.

### Metier level 6

The metier level 6 is defined in the DCF EU-MAP and is managed by the RCG ISSG Metier and transversal variables, and used for reporting in FDI and ICES data calls. The code has the components 'Gear'_'Target species assemblage'_'Mesh size range'_'Selection devices'. See more documentation at: https://github.com/ices-eg/RCGs/tree/master/Metiers.

Note: There can be a difference between the gears reported in the GEAR_TYPE variable and in the Metier code on level 4.

As there are many minor metier codes, only the top 10 metier codes by fishing days are shown in the plot below, the rest are grouped into 'Other'.

The first plot is showing the fishing days by metier level 6 within CS fleet at EU level. 

The second plot is showing the fishing days by metier level 6 within CS fleet at country level, where the y-axis is not fixed. 

The third plot is showing the fishing days by metier level 6 within CS fleet at country level, where the y-axis is fixed, so it is easier to get an overview of the relative fishing effort by MS. 

The fourth plot is showing the fishing days by metier level 6 within CS fleet at country level, where the y-axis is shown as percentage.

The Country level is filtered by the CS countries, gears and areas. When submitting data to the FDI the country can mark data as confidential, typically if there are less than 3 vessels in the aggregation level of data submission. In this plot, the difference between the effort on EU level and the country level is added as 'Unknown'. This difference can be due to data marked as confidential, but can also be due to other MS than the ones defined in the case study have fishing effort in this fleet.

The Country level is filtered by the CS countries, gears and areas. When submitting data to the FDI the country can mark data as confidential, typically if there are less than 3 vessels in the aggregation level of data submission. Therefore a part of the effort is missing in this plot.

The third plot is showing the effort as kW Days at sea by year, when filtering the effort at Country level for the CIBBRiNA case study fleets. The Country level is filtered by the CS countries, gears and areas. When submitting data to the FDI the country can mark data as confidential, typically if there are less than 3 vessels in the aggregation level of data submission. In this plot, the difference between the effort on EU level and the country level is added as 'Unknown'. This difference can be due to data marked as confidential, but can also be due to other MS than the ones defined in the case study have fishing effort in this fleet.

### Vessel length

The first plot is showing the fishing days by vessel length categories within CS fleet at EU level. 

The second plot is showing the fishing days by vessel length categories within CS fleet at country level, where the y-axis is not fixed. 

The third plot is showing the fishing days by vessel length categories within CS fleet at country level, where the y-axis is fixed, so it is easier to get an overview of the relative fishing effort by MS. 

The fourth plot is showing the fishing days by vessel length categories within CS fleet at country level, where the y-axis is shown as percentage.

### Metier level 6

The metier level 6 is defined in the DCF EU-MAP and is managed by the RCG ISSG Metier and transversal variables, and used for reporting in FDI and ICES data calls. The code has the components 'Gear'_'Target species assemblage'_'Mesh size range'_'Selection devices'. See more documentation at: https://github.com/ices-eg/RCGs/tree/master/Metiers.

Note: There can be a difference between the gears reported in the GEAR_TYPE variable and in the Metier code on level 4.

As there are many minor metier codes, only the top 10 metier codes by fishing days are shown in the plot below, the rest are grouped into 'Other'.

The first plot is showing the fishing days by metier level 6 within CS fleet at EU level. 

The second plot is showing the fishing days by metier level 6 within CS fleet at country level, where the y-axis is not fixed. 

The third plot is showing the fishing days by metier level 6 within CS fleet at country level, where the y-axis is fixed, so it is easier to get an overview of the relative fishing effort by MS. 

The fourth plot is showing the fishing days by metier level 6 within CS fleet at country level, where the y-axis is shown as percentage.

### Days at sea by year

The first plot is showing the effort as Days at sea by year, when filtering the effort at EU level for the CIBBRiNA case study fleets. The EU level can only be filtered by gears and areas, and not by country.

The second plot is showing the effort as Days at sea by year, when filtering the effort at Country level for the CIBBRiNA case study fleets. The Country level is filtered by the CS countries, gears and areas. When submitting data to the FDI the country can mark data as confidential, typically if there are less than 3 vessels in the aggregation level of data submission. Therefore a part of the effort is missing in this plot.

The third plot is showing the effort as Days at sea by year, when filtering the effort at Country level for the CIBBRiNA case study fleets. The Country level is filtered by the CS countries, gears and areas. When submitting data to the FDI the country can mark data as confidential, typically if there are less than 3 vessels in the aggregation level of data submission. In this plot, the difference between the effort on EU level and the country level is added as 'Unknown'. This difference can be due to data marked as confidential, but can also be due to other MS than the ones defined in the case study have fishing effort in this fleet.

### Vessel length

The first plot is showing the fishing days by vessel length categories within CS fleet at EU level. 

The second plot is showing the fishing days by vessel length categories within CS fleet at country level, where the y-axis is not fixed. 

The third plot is showing the fishing days by vessel length categories within CS fleet at country level, where the y-axis is fixed, so it is easier to get an overview of the relative fishing effort by MS. 

The fourth plot is showing the fishing days by vessel length categories within CS fleet at country level, where the y-axis is shown as percentage.

### Metier level 6

The metier level 6 is defined in the DCF EU-MAP and is managed by the RCG ISSG Metier and transversal variables, and used for reporting in FDI and ICES data calls. The code has the components 'Gear'_'Target species assemblage'_'Mesh size range'_'Selection devices'. See more documentation at: https://github.com/ices-eg/RCGs/tree/master/Metiers.

Note: There can be a difference between the gears reported in the GEAR_TYPE variable and in the Metier code on level 4.

As there are many minor metier codes, only the top 10 metier codes by fishing days are shown in the plot below, the rest are grouped into 'Other'.

The first plot is showing the fishing days by metier level 6 within CS fleet at EU level. 

The second plot is showing the fishing days by metier level 6 within CS fleet at country level, where the y-axis is not fixed. 

The third plot is showing the fishing days by metier level 6 within CS fleet at country level, where the y-axis is fixed, so it is easier to get an overview of the relative fishing effort by MS. 

The fourth plot is showing the fishing days by metier level 6 within CS fleet at country level, where the y-axis is shown as percentage.
